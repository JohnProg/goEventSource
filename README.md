# EventSource for Go
This library is an initial implementation of Server Sent Events(SSE)/EventSource for Go.
It is patterned after the [Go Websockets](https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/?repo=net#hg%2Fwebsocket) library.
It is very much a work in progress. Pull requests welcome.

## Development
Please write tests for any code that you add. To run existing tests, run:

`bin/test`
